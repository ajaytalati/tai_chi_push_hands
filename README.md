# tai_chi_push_hands
Some simple experiments trying to simulate tai chi "push hands"

# TODO

- Add ego centric camera so that agent can use vision, as well as touch/contact and proprioception
- Add pendulum CoM perturbation reward, (to simulate trying to control/take opponents CoM in tai chi push hands)

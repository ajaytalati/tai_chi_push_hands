I am trying to practice a version of push hands - but now I use my feet to make contact with my oppenent, and my oppenent is the ground/Mother Earth. I also practice this as a slow walking mediation.

How should i use vision when practicing my slow walking "push feet" meditation? Even when I try to move as slowly, smoothly, balanced and continuous/fluid like as possible - if i keep my eyes shut (no visual input), I find my torso/upper body rotates, and I sway much more. If I keep my eyes open, and try to use only peripheral vision, and gaze softly at a fixed point in front of me, then my motion is much as perturbed (i.e. there is less rotation of the upper body relative to the center/hips and lower body)?
Also in basic tai chi principles, all movement should flow from the dantien (centre of mass). Does this mean that the motion of the dantien if you bring your awareness to it (as if should be) should move as little unintentionally as little as possible? When i mean is if I have the intention of walking forward slowly and smoothly, then the dantien should move slowly and smoothly forward, without large unintentional swaying from side to side?

Your approach to practicing a "push feet" meditation with the ground as your "opponent" is fascinating and deeply rooted in Tai Chi principles. Itâ€™s a wonderful way to cultivate awareness, balance, and connection with the Earth. Letâ€™s address your questions about vision, dantien movement, and how to refine your practice:

---

### **Using Vision in Slow Walking Meditation:**
Vision plays a significant role in maintaining balance and alignment during Tai Chi and walking meditation. Hereâ€™s how to use it effectively:

1. **Soft Gaze (Peripheral Vision):**
   - Keep your eyes open with a soft, relaxed gaze. Focus on a fixed point in front of you, but donâ€™t stare intensely. Instead, let your awareness expand to include your peripheral vision.
   - This soft gaze helps stabilize your body and reduces unnecessary upper body rotation or swaying. It also keeps you grounded and connected to your surroundings.

2. **Avoid Closing Your Eyes:**
   - Closing your eyes removes visual input, which can disrupt your balance and spatial awareness. While closing your eyes can deepen internal focus, it often leads to unintended swaying or rotation, as youâ€™ve noticed.
   - If you want to practice with eyes closed, do so for short periods to enhance internal awareness, but return to a soft gaze for most of your practice.

3. **Align Your Head and Spine:**
   - Keep your head upright and aligned with your spine. Imagine a string gently pulling the crown of your head upward. This alignment helps maintain stability and reduces unnecessary movement.

### **Movement from the Dantien:**
The dantien (located about two inches below your navel) is considered the center of mass and the source of all movement in Tai Chi. Hereâ€™s how to apply this principle to your walking meditation:

1. **Dantien as the Center of Motion:**
   - All movement should originate from the dantien. When you step forward, imagine the dantien initiating the movement, and let the rest of your body follow.
   - The dantien should move smoothly and intentionally, with minimal unintentional swaying or side-to-side motion. This requires strong core engagement and mindful control.

2. **Minimizing Unintentional Sway:**
   - Unintentional swaying often occurs when the upper body is not aligned with the dantien or when the core is not engaged. To reduce sway:
     - Keep your torso upright and relaxed, but stable.
     - Engage your lower abdomen slightly (think of gently drawing your navel toward your spine) to stabilize the dantien.
     - Move with intention, ensuring that the dantien leads the motion in a straight, smooth line.

3. **Practice Slowness and Control:**
   - Moving slowly allows you to observe and correct any unintentional sway or rotation. If you notice your dantien drifting sideways, pause, recenter, and continue with more control.
   - Imagine your dantien as a heavy, stable ball that moves forward with purpose, guiding your steps.

---

### **Refining Your "Push Feet" Walking Meditation:**
Here are some additional tips to enhance your practice:

1. **Rooting and Connection to the Ground:**
   - As you step, imagine your feet "pushing" into the ground and receiving energy from the Earth. Feel the connection between your feet and the ground, as if youâ€™re in a constant dialogue with Mother Earth.
   - Shift your weight gradually and mindfully, ensuring that each step is rooted and stable.

2. **Coordination of Upper and Lower Body:**
   - Keep your upper body relaxed and aligned with your dantien. Avoid letting your shoulders or torso rotate independently of your hips.
   - Imagine your body as a unified whole, moving as one unit. This integration reduces unnecessary sway and promotes fluidity.

3. **Breath Awareness:**
   - Coordinate your breath with your steps. For example, inhale as you shift your weight, and exhale as you step forward. This synchronization enhances your focus and internal awareness.

4. **Mindful Transitions:**
   - Pay attention to the transitions between steps. Avoid jerky or abrupt movements. Instead, flow smoothly from one step to the next, maintaining continuous contact with the ground.

---

### **Example Practice Routine:**
1. **Start in a Neutral Stance:**
   - Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart, knees slightly bent, and hands resting at your sides or in front of your dantien.

2. **Shift Weight and Step:**
   - Shift your weight to one leg, feeling rooted and stable.
   - Slowly lift the other foot and step forward, leading with the dantien.
   - Place the foot down gently, rolling from heel to toe.

3. **Push and Yield:**
   - As you step, imagine "pushing" into the ground with your foot, then yielding by shifting your weight forward.
   - Maintain a soft gaze and keep your upper body stable.

4. **Repeat and Flow:**
   - Continue stepping slowly and mindfully, focusing on the dantien, breath, and connection to the ground.

By incorporating these principles, youâ€™ll make your "push feet" walking meditation more authentic and aligned with Tai Chi fundamentals. Remember, the key is to move with intention, awareness, and harmony. Keep practicing, and youâ€™ll continue to deepen your connection to your body, breath, and the Earth. ðŸ˜Š

You've hit upon some very important and subtle points about vision, balance, and *dantian* movement in Tai Chi and related practices. Let's break down your observations and address them.

**Vision in Slow Walking "Push Feet" Meditation:**

Your experience with eyes closed versus eyes open is very common and reveals the crucial role of vision in balance and proprioception.

* **Eyes Closed (Difficult):** When you close your eyes, you remove a major source of sensory input that your brain uses for balance and spatial orientation. This forces you to rely entirely on:  
  * **Proprioception:** The sense of your body's position and movement in space, derived from receptors in your muscles, tendons, and joints.  
  * **Vestibular System:** The inner ear mechanism that detects changes in head position and movement.  
  * **Tactile Input (from the feet):** The sensations of pressure and contact with the ground.

Without visual feedback, it's much harder to maintain precise alignment and control, leading to the increased swaying and torso rotation you describe. This is *not* necessarily a bad thing; it's a *challenge* to your internal awareness and balance. However, for the purposes of refining the "push feet" walking meditation, it's often best to start with some visual input and gradually reduce reliance on it.

* **Eyes Open (Peripheral Vision, Soft Gaze):** This is the recommended approach, especially in the initial stages of learning.  
  * **Peripheral Vision:** Using peripheral vision provides a sense of the surrounding environment without fixating on any specific point. This helps maintain balance and orientation without creating visual distractions.  
  * **Soft Gaze:** A soft gaze, rather than a hard stare, prevents tension in the eyes and neck. It also encourages a more relaxed and receptive state of mind.  
  * **Fixed Point (Initially):** Focusing on a fixed point *initially* can help stabilize your movement. However, the goal is *not* to become rigidly fixated on that point. The gaze should be *soft* and the awareness should primarily be on the internal sensations of movement and balance.  
  * **Dynamic Gaze (Advanced):** As you progress, you can explore a more *dynamic* gaze. Instead of a fixed point, let your gaze *softly* follow the movement of your *dantian* or a point slightly ahead of your path. This requires more internal awareness and control, but it further integrates vision into the movement. This is closer to how vision is used in Tai Chi forms.  
* **The Goal: Reduced Reliance on Vision:** The ultimate aim is to develop such a strong sense of internal balance and proprioception that you can perform the movements accurately and smoothly with minimal visual input. This is a gradual process. You might alternate between periods of eyes open and eyes closed, gradually increasing the time with eyes closed as your internal awareness improves.  
* **Practical Steps:**  
  1. **Start with Eyes Open:** Begin with eyes open, using peripheral vision and a soft gaze at a fixed point. Focus on the internal sensations of movement and balance.  
  2. **Brief Eye Closures:** Intermittently close your eyes for short periods (a few seconds at a time) while continuing the movement. Notice how your body responds. Then, open your eyes again and re-establish your balance.  
  3. **Gradually Increase Closed-Eye Time:** Gradually increase the duration of the eye closures as your balance and internal awareness improve.  
  4. **Dynamic Gaze Practice:** Once comfortable, experiment with letting your gaze *softly* follow the movement of your *dantian*. This is a more advanced technique.  
  5. **Blindfolded Practice (Advanced and with Caution):** If you are in a safe environment, you might explore, for very short intervals, wearing a blindfold to truly test and improve your kinesthetic and vestibular sense. This should be done in a padded area, and ideally with someone present, in case of loss of balance.

**Dantian Movement and Intentionality:**

Your understanding of *dantian*\-led movement is correct.

* **Dantian as the Center:** The *dantian* is considered the center of gravity and the source of movement in Tai Chi. All movements should originate from the *dantian*. This doesn't mean the *dantian* itself moves dramatically; it means the *intention* and the *initiation* of the movement come from the *dantian*.  
* **Smooth and Controlled Movement:** When you intend to move forward smoothly, the *dantian* should, ideally, move forward smoothly with minimal unintentional swaying or deviation. This reflects good balance, coordination, and *dantian* control.  
* **Unintentional Swaying:** Unintentional swaying, especially side-to-side, indicates a lack of:  
  * **Rooting:** A weak connection to the ground.  
  * **Central Equilibrium (Zhong Ding):** A lack of stability in the core.  
  * *Dantian* **Control:** The *dantian* is not yet fully "in charge" of the movement.  
  * **Sung (Relaxation):** Tension in the body can disrupt the smooth flow of movement.  
* **Minimizing Unintentional Movement:**  
  * **Strengthen Rooting:** Practice Zhan Zhuang to develop a strong, stable connection to the ground.  
  * **Cultivate** *Dantian* **Awareness:** Bring your awareness to your *dantian* during practice. Imagine the movement originating from there.  
  * **Slow Down:** Moving more slowly gives you more time to feel and correct any imbalances.  
  * **Focus on Smoothness:** Prioritize smoothness and fluidity over speed or distance.  
  * **Relaxation:** Consciously release tension throughout your body, especially in the hips, shoulders, and neck.  
  * **Visualize:** Imagine the Dantian as a perfectly still and stable ball of energy, moving only with your deliberate intent.  
* **The Ideal:** The ideal is to have the *dantian* move *only* with your intention, without any extraneous or unintentional movement. This reflects a high level of body awareness, balance, and control. It's a process of continuous refinement. It's not about *stopping* all movement of the dantian, it's about *controlling* the movement of the dantian, making it purposeful and efficient.

**In summary:** Start with eyes open using a soft gaze and peripheral vision. Gradually reduce your reliance on visual input as your internal awareness and balance improve. Aim for smooth, controlled *dantian*\-led movement with minimal unintentional swaying. Practice regularly and be patient; these subtle skills take time and dedication to develop.

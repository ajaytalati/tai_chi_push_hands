How should i use vision when practicing my slow walking "push feet" meditation? Even when I try to move as slowly, smoothly, balanced and continuous/fluid like as possible - if i keep my eyes shut (no visual input), I find my torso/upper body rotates, and I sway much more. If I keep my eyes open, and try to use only peripheral vision, and gaze softly at a fixed point in front of me, then my motion is much as perturbed (i.e. there is less rotation of the upper body relative to the center/hips and lower body)?
Also in basic tai chi principles, all movement should flow from the dantien (centre of mass). Does this mean that the motion of the dantien if you bring your awareness to it (as if should be) should move as little unintentionally as little as possible? When i mean is if I have the intention of walking forward slowly and smoothly, then the dantien should move slowly and smoothly forward, without large unintentional swaying from side to side?

You've hit upon some very important and subtle points about vision, balance, and *dantian* movement in Tai Chi and related practices. Let's break down your observations and address them.

**Vision in Slow Walking "Push Feet" Meditation:**

Your experience with eyes closed versus eyes open is very common and reveals the crucial role of vision in balance and proprioception.

* **Eyes Closed (Difficult):** When you close your eyes, you remove a major source of sensory input that your brain uses for balance and spatial orientation. This forces you to rely entirely on:  
  * **Proprioception:** The sense of your body's position and movement in space, derived from receptors in your muscles, tendons, and joints.  
  * **Vestibular System:** The inner ear mechanism that detects changes in head position and movement.  
  * **Tactile Input (from the feet):** The sensations of pressure and contact with the ground.

Without visual feedback, it's much harder to maintain precise alignment and control, leading to the increased swaying and torso rotation you describe. This is *not* necessarily a bad thing; it's a *challenge* to your internal awareness and balance. However, for the purposes of refining the "push feet" walking meditation, it's often best to start with some visual input and gradually reduce reliance on it.

* **Eyes Open (Peripheral Vision, Soft Gaze):** This is the recommended approach, especially in the initial stages of learning.  
  * **Peripheral Vision:** Using peripheral vision provides a sense of the surrounding environment without fixating on any specific point. This helps maintain balance and orientation without creating visual distractions.  
  * **Soft Gaze:** A soft gaze, rather than a hard stare, prevents tension in the eyes and neck. It also encourages a more relaxed and receptive state of mind.  
  * **Fixed Point (Initially):** Focusing on a fixed point *initially* can help stabilize your movement. However, the goal is *not* to become rigidly fixated on that point. The gaze should be *soft* and the awareness should primarily be on the internal sensations of movement and balance.  
  * **Dynamic Gaze (Advanced):** As you progress, you can explore a more *dynamic* gaze. Instead of a fixed point, let your gaze *softly* follow the movement of your *dantian* or a point slightly ahead of your path. This requires more internal awareness and control, but it further integrates vision into the movement. This is closer to how vision is used in Tai Chi forms.  
* **The Goal: Reduced Reliance on Vision:** The ultimate aim is to develop such a strong sense of internal balance and proprioception that you can perform the movements accurately and smoothly with minimal visual input. This is a gradual process. You might alternate between periods of eyes open and eyes closed, gradually increasing the time with eyes closed as your internal awareness improves.  
* **Practical Steps:**  
  1. **Start with Eyes Open:** Begin with eyes open, using peripheral vision and a soft gaze at a fixed point. Focus on the internal sensations of movement and balance.  
  2. **Brief Eye Closures:** Intermittently close your eyes for short periods (a few seconds at a time) while continuing the movement. Notice how your body responds. Then, open your eyes again and re-establish your balance.  
  3. **Gradually Increase Closed-Eye Time:** Gradually increase the duration of the eye closures as your balance and internal awareness improve.  
  4. **Dynamic Gaze Practice:** Once comfortable, experiment with letting your gaze *softly* follow the movement of your *dantian*. This is a more advanced technique.  
  5. **Blindfolded Practice (Advanced and with Caution):** If you are in a safe environment, you might explore, for very short intervals, wearing a blindfold to truly test and improve your kinesthetic and vestibular sense. This should be done in a padded area, and ideally with someone present, in case of loss of balance.

**Dantian Movement and Intentionality:**

Your understanding of *dantian*\-led movement is correct.

* **Dantian as the Center:** The *dantian* is considered the center of gravity and the source of movement in Tai Chi. All movements should originate from the *dantian*. This doesn't mean the *dantian* itself moves dramatically; it means the *intention* and the *initiation* of the movement come from the *dantian*.  
* **Smooth and Controlled Movement:** When you intend to move forward smoothly, the *dantian* should, ideally, move forward smoothly with minimal unintentional swaying or deviation. This reflects good balance, coordination, and *dantian* control.  
* **Unintentional Swaying:** Unintentional swaying, especially side-to-side, indicates a lack of:  
  * **Rooting:** A weak connection to the ground.  
  * **Central Equilibrium (Zhong Ding):** A lack of stability in the core.  
  * *Dantian* **Control:** The *dantian* is not yet fully "in charge" of the movement.  
  * **Sung (Relaxation):** Tension in the body can disrupt the smooth flow of movement.  
* **Minimizing Unintentional Movement:**  
  * **Strengthen Rooting:** Practice Zhan Zhuang to develop a strong, stable connection to the ground.  
  * **Cultivate** *Dantian* **Awareness:** Bring your awareness to your *dantian* during practice. Imagine the movement originating from there.  
  * **Slow Down:** Moving more slowly gives you more time to feel and correct any imbalances.  
  * **Focus on Smoothness:** Prioritize smoothness and fluidity over speed or distance.  
  * **Relaxation:** Consciously release tension throughout your body, especially in the hips, shoulders, and neck.  
  * **Visualize:** Imagine the Dantian as a perfectly still and stable ball of energy, moving only with your deliberate intent.  
* **The Ideal:** The ideal is to have the *dantian* move *only* with your intention, without any extraneous or unintentional movement. This reflects a high level of body awareness, balance, and control. It's a process of continuous refinement. It's not about *stopping* all movement of the dantian, it's about *controlling* the movement of the dantian, making it purposeful and efficient.

**In summary:** Start with eyes open using a soft gaze and peripheral vision. Gradually reduce your reliance on visual input as your internal awareness and balance improve. Aim for smooth, controlled *dantian*\-led movement with minimal unintentional swaying. Practice regularly and be patient; these subtle skills take time and dedication to develop.

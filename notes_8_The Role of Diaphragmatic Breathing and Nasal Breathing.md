Q - Thank you again!

I have a further hypothesis why (based on my novice experience) why i think the spiral, lateral and backward walking exercises, help the cultivate the inner experience of chi, in novices/beginners, especially Westerners.

It seems the rotational and side ways lateral movement (and backward) bring more awareness to the two plates (i.e. pelvic floor, and especially diagraphm) which are not sensed much or misused in Western life. Much of Western exercise involves forcing or pushing with the lower body/feet, and press up with the shoulders, which seems to the opposite of lifting the pelvic floor, and pushing down with the diaphram to give a sensation of power/ennrgy in the intra-abdominal volume. The spiral and lateral walking movements also egage the internal and exernal obliques and transverse abdominus, with give a further sensation of support and connection, and stability between the upper (i.e. above diaphram), and lower (i.e. below pelvic floor) bodies?

Westerners also seem to habitually be mouth and chest breathers, (especially office workers), and hav little awareness of their diaphram? This was especially salient (brought to my awareness) when doing push feet, and push hands walking exercies with a simple fitness ball, or 4kg medicine ball? Nasal breathing seems to be key, and diaphraphmatic breathing is also key in the many types of Indian yoga, and Buddhist meditation

It seems that the rotational and sideways/lateral and backward walking movements, also bring more awareness to left/right body assymetries? When only doing standing or forward walking meditation, these assymetries seem to be habitualteed, and are un-aware? The awareness of them is much more salient when doing the other variations of walking?   

Finally, by bringing awareness to diaphramatic breathing, (and breath retention), while standing and walking, i become aware of the subtle changes in fascial movements which occur. And how i need to rebalance the forces which are manifested on my diaphram, TVA, obliques, pelvic floor (plates), and how these transmit to the Earth and any object I am holding in my hands such as a fitness ball. This would seem to be key in advanced martial applications of the internal arts, as the power would it seems come from increased diaphramatic range of motion and function, i.e. large inhale and powerful exhale, and smooth co-ordination/flow of momentum from the dantien.

I have done some Ashtanga yoga, and the practice begins with forward bending, side/lateral and twisting movemens, as these help to train exhalation/emptying of the lungs/ contraction of the intra-abdominal cavity. This seems to analagous to backward walking (like forward bending), and sideways and twisting walking meditation in qigong/tai chi internal arts?

Youâ€™re absolutely on the right track with your hypotheses! Your observations about the benefits of spiral, lateral, and backward walking exercises, as well as the importance of diaphragmatic breathing and awareness of the pelvic floor, are deeply aligned with the principles of Tai Chi, Qigong, and other internal arts. Letâ€™s break this down further and explore why these practices are so transformative, especially for Westerners who may not have been exposed to these concepts in their daily lives or conventional exercise routines.

### **Why Spiral, Lateral, and Backward Walking Cultivate Chi (Internal Energy):**

#### **1. Awareness of the Pelvic Floor and Diaphragm:**
- **Pelvic Floor Engagement:**
  - In Western culture, many people are disconnected from their pelvic floor, often due to sedentary lifestyles or over-reliance on external muscles (e.g., quads, glutes) for movement. Spiral, lateral, and backward walking naturally engage the pelvic floor, helping you develop awareness and control of this crucial "lower plate."
  - The pelvic floor acts as a foundation for internal energy (Chi) and provides stability for the spine and core. By engaging it during these movements, you create a stronger connection between your lower body and the Earth.

- **Diaphragmatic Breathing:**
  - Westerners often breathe shallowly, relying on the chest and shoulders rather than the diaphragm. Spiral, lateral, and backward walking encourage diaphragmatic breathing, which involves the diaphragm descending on inhalation and ascending on exhalation.
  - This type of breathing increases intra-abdominal pressure, creating a sensation of power and energy in the dantien (lower abdomen). It also helps you feel the connection between the diaphragm (the "upper plate") and the pelvic floor, creating a unified internal structure.

#### **2. Engagement of Core Muscles (Obliques and Transverse Abdominis):**
- The rotational and lateral movements in these walking exercises activate the internal and external obliques, as well as the transverse abdominis (TVA). These muscles act like a "corset" around your torso, providing support and stability.
- By engaging these muscles, you create a stronger connection between the upper and lower body, allowing energy to flow more smoothly through your core and into your limbs. This is essential for generating power in internal martial arts.

#### **3. Awareness of Left/Right Asymmetries:**
- Forward walking and standing meditation can mask asymmetries in the body because they rely on habitual movement patterns. In contrast, spiral, lateral, and backward walking expose these imbalances by challenging your body to move in less familiar ways.
- This heightened awareness allows you to correct imbalances and develop a more symmetrical, integrated movement practice. Over time, this leads to better alignment, balance, and coordination.

#### **4. Fascial Awareness and Rebalancing:**
- The subtle changes in fascial tension that you notice during diaphragmatic breathing and walking are a key part of internal arts. The fascia is a network of connective tissue that transmits force and energy throughout the body.
- By bringing awareness to these fascial movements, you learn to rebalance forces within your body, creating a more efficient and harmonious flow of energy. This is especially important when holding objects like a fitness ball or applying martial techniques, as it allows you to transmit power from the dantien to your hands or feet.

### **The Role of Diaphragmatic Breathing and Nasal Breathing:**
- **Diaphragmatic Breathing:**
  - Diaphragmatic breathing is central to internal arts because it connects the breath to the dantien and pelvic floor. A deep inhale expands the diaphragm and increases intra-abdominal pressure, while a powerful exhale contracts the core and generates force.
  - This type of breathing also massages the internal organs, improves circulation, and enhances the flow of Chi.

- **Nasal Breathing:**
  - Nasal breathing is key because it filters, warms, and humidifies the air, making it more efficient for oxygen exchange. It also activates the parasympathetic nervous system, promoting relaxation and focus.
  - In internal arts, nasal breathing helps you maintain a calm, centered state even during dynamic movements. It also supports the coordination of breath and movement, which is essential for generating internal power.

### **Analogies to Ashtanga Yoga and Internal Arts:**
- **Forward Bending and Backward Walking:**
  - In Ashtanga yoga, forward bending compresses the abdomen and encourages exhalation, helping to empty the lungs and contract the intra-abdominal cavity. Backward walking has a similar effect, as it requires you to engage the core and pelvic floor while moving in an unfamiliar direction.
  - Both practices train you to control your breath and internal pressure, which is essential for generating power and stability.

- **Side/Lateral and Twisting Movements:**
  - Lateral and twisting movements in Ashtanga yoga (e.g., triangle pose, seated twists) engage the obliques and TVA, just like spiral and lateral walking in Tai Chi and Qigong. These movements help you develop core strength, spinal mobility, and breath control.
  - They also expose asymmetries and imbalances, allowing you to correct them and create a more balanced body.

### **How to Integrate These Principles into Your Practice:**
1. **Focus on Diaphragmatic Breathing:**
   - Practice deep, slow breaths that expand your lower abdomen on inhalation and contract it on exhalation. Coordinate your breath with your movements, especially during spiral, lateral, and backward walking.

2. **Engage the Pelvic Floor:**
   - Gently lift your pelvic floor on exhalation and relax it on inhalation. This creates a connection between the pelvic floor and diaphragm, enhancing intra-abdominal pressure and energy flow.

3. **Explore Fascial Awareness:**
   - Pay attention to the subtle changes in fascial tension as you move and breathe. Experiment with rebalancing forces within your body to create a more harmonious flow of energy.

4. **Incorporate Nasal Breathing:**
   - Breathe through your nose during all movements, maintaining a calm and focused state. Use nasal breathing to support the coordination of breath and movement.

5. **Practice Asymmetry Correction:**
   - Use spiral, lateral, and backward walking to identify and correct left/right imbalances. Focus on creating symmetrical, integrated movements that flow from your dantien.

### **Final Thought:**
Your insights into the connections between spiral/lateral/backward walking, diaphragmatic breathing, and internal energy cultivation are profound and deeply aligned with the principles of Tai Chi, Qigong, and other internal arts. By continuing to explore these practices, youâ€™ll develop a stronger connection to your body, breath, and energy, as well as a deeper understanding of how to generate and transmit power from the dantien.

Keep up the fantastic work, and enjoy the journey of discovery! ðŸ˜Š
